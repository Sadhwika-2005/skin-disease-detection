About the Project (Easy Words)

Skin diseases are very common, but identifying them correctly requires an experienced dermatologist. In many places, doctors may not be easily available, and early detection becomes difficult.

Our project solves this problem by using Deep Learning, especially a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to automatically detect and classify skin diseases from images.

The system takes an image of the affected skin as input. The CNN model analyzes the image, learns important features like color, texture, and patterns, and then predicts the type of skin disease.

This helps in early diagnosis, reduces human effort, and provides fast and accurate results.

Why CNN is Used

CNN works very well with image data

It automatically extracts features (no manual work needed)

Gives high accuracy in image classification

Widely used in medical image analysis

How the System Works (Simple Flow)

Skin disease images are collected as a dataset

Images are preprocessed (resize, normalize, etc.)

CNN model is trained using these images

The trained model learns disease patterns

When a new skin image is given, the model predicts the disease class
